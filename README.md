# Rainbow-RestRoom

## üí° Inspiration

**[Gender-Neutral-restroom perspective]** üöΩ We are born in Asian countries where non-binary individuals and people from the LGBTQ+ community do not have many restroom choices, they will need to think about which room is suitable for either themselves or the community. We appreciate how neutral-gender restroom is normalized in the US, which means there are more space and privacy for everyone regardless of their gender. Therefore, we build Rainbow RestRoom for many purposes. On the one hand, we want to help students on campus to find a restroom location that is convenient for them. On the other hand, by building this website we hope to popularize the neutral-gender restroom so that people can take the neutral-gender restroom as a necessary element in today human's life. 

**[Menstrual Supplies]** ü©∏ As women students, we understand the need for menstrual supplies around campus because it would be a painful experience if we don't have access to menstrual products when we need them. Hence, we decided to add the finding menstrual supplies function to our website that helps students find free menstrual supplies in their campus restrooms. Our purpose is to alleviate the discomfort and stress that women have to face when on their period and create an ecosystem where they don't have to worry about not having products - where they get help and help other people nearby the donating function. 

**[Disabled People]** ü¶Ω There is a good sign that almost all campuses have an accessible entrance where people with disability can easily go inside the building. To build a stronger community, we help the universities to inform people with accessible entrances to make their life more convenient. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è What it does 

**Rainbow RestRoom is a website that lets students living on campus to find the nearest restroom on their campus including those with and without menstrual products.** To make the user experience better, we also let students rate and comment on the condition of the restroom. By doing this, we are not only tracking the cleanliness, but we are also letting people from the non-binary community find their **Safe Zone**, where they can receive the respect of nearby people. Track and update the availability of menstrual supplies, and donate menstrual products to the location. 

**An overview of the functions of the website is as below:**

 **1.** Search and find restrooms filtered by campus. In this hackathon, **we are focusing on 2 universities campuses ( DePauw University and Tufts University )**

 **2.** Search and find a location with **menstrual supplies** - filter campus which menstrual products are available (pads, tampons, cups, lines, etc).

**3.** Search and find **accessible entrances** for disabled people filtered by campus 

**4.** **Submit a restroom**, let students report a new location, and updated it to the map after checking. ( This can do either by form or by chatbot) 

**5.** **Rating System**, let students rate and comment on the restroom to give other users an overview of the restroom before using. 

**6.** **Donating system**, let other people nearby donate the menstrual products to the restroom to help other women. 


## üîß How we built it

- We designed a website using **HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and Bootstrap.** 

- We had also applied **Google Cloud** to create a chatbot using **Dialogflow** that allows users to chat with the system to report a new restroom on campus. 

- We used **Google Maps API** to customize the campus's map and pin the location that is useful for the users.

## Challenges we ran into üôÅ

**Brainstorming:** Since the topic of gender neutrality is popular, it takes our team a while to develop a website that is unique and had a real societal influence. 

**Building:**  It is also a challenging Hackathon that we need to work in new areas which we were unfamiliar with, such as handling databases, making and customizing maps, and applying Google Cloud to the website to build a good project. Handling both backend and frontend at the same time within a weekend is also a big challenge for us. 

**Other:** Members of the team are also at a different timezone, so we also need to come up with a schedule and responsibility that works for all timezone. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of üòá

We're proud of successfully making a product that had both a front and back end. This is not our first hackathon, but this is our first time working together as 3 women in a team and building a website with multiple applications that we are passionate about. This was a very good experience for us, working remotely regardless of the timezone and effectively communicating to come up with a complete product. 


## What we learned ü§î

During the hackathon time span, we have learned various new tech stacks such as **Google Cloud** DialogFlow chatbots, **Google Maps API** for our map customization, website deployment using **Github Pages** as well as learned how to collaborate on **GitHub**. Last but not least we understood the meaning of team collaboration.


## üöÄ How we have used **Github** in our project? üöÄ

We used Github in different ways:

**Pull Requests and Issues:** We created pull requests on our GitHub repository as we were a team of three and we're working on our local repository. If any of our team members gets an idea for a new feature, she created the issue for all members to see and suggest their opinions on how to implement it.

**Github Branches** Github branches helped a lot for beta testing of updated code before merging the new code into the original code. Our team approximately created 4-5 branches during the hackathon.

**Github Pages** we deployed our website at https://akshitagupta15june.github.io/Rainbow-RestRoom/ using Github pages. It was really simple to deploy our site through GitHub pages and we are planning to use this feature in future hackathons.

**Github Templates** We used the Github default LICENSE template for adding an MIT license to our project.

**Github Actions** Although implementing the actions was a kind of hectic task for our team but we tried to implement them for our pull requests. We still had to learn about GitHub's actions for future hackathons.


## üì≤ What's next for Rainbow Restroom üì≤

1) We will try to add more university campuses to our database.

2) Our team will not only target campuses but also the city.

3) We will work on our website to improve its UI/UX.
